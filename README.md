## Duckbone Sample Application

This "ticket tracker" application is a demonstration and tutorial for the Duckbone gem, a set of extensions to Backbone.js for Rails development. Think of it as a more grown up To Do List example.

### Installation

This is a vanilla Rails 3.1 project. To install and run:

```
git clone git@github.com:maxl0rd/duckbone-tickets.git
cd duckbone-tickets
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:setup
rails s
```

The seeds file will generate a bunch of sample tickets for you to play with.
